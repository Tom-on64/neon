# Neon
_A ~~fast~~, ~~efficient~~, low-level, compiled programming language._

## Usage
_See [Docs](docs/main.md) for more info_

To compile a neon program, run:
```sh
neon /path/to/file.ne -o /output/file
```

To see compiler flags, run:
```sh
neon -h # or `neon --help`
```

## Building
If you want to build neon yourself, run these commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tom-on64/neon.git # Clone the repo
cd neon # Change into the source directory
make # Builds the project, output will be in ./bin/neon
```

## Development
### You can find the TODOs [Here](docs/todo.md)
_More about development coming soon enough_
