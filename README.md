# Neon
_A ~~Stable~~, ~~Fast~~, Low-level, Compiled Programming Language_

## Usage
_[See docs for more info](./docs/main.md)_

### Syntax
Neon's syntax is a blend between C and JavaScript with some extra things for convenience sake.

### Compiling
To compile a program written in Neon, you can use the Neon Compiler.\
`$ neon ./path/to/file.ne -o ./output/file`\
Then you can run the executable like this:\
`./output/file`

To see all compiler options, use the `-h` flag.\
`$ neon -h`

_Note: There currently isn't an executable, 
so you can use `$ node ./src/main.js <flags>`_

### Building Neon
If you want to compile neon yourself, you can run these commands:
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/Tom-on64/neon.git # Clones the repo
$ npm run build # Builds the exe into ./build
```

## Development
### You can find todos [Here](./todo.txt).

_More about development coming soon_
